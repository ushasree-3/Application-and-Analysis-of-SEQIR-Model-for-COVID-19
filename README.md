# SEQIR Model Analysis for COVID-19
## Project Overview
This project applies the SEQIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Quarantined, Infected, Recovered) model to analyze the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The objective is to understand how factors such as susceptibility, exposure, quarantine measures, infection, and recovery influence the spread of the virus. Through this analysis, the project aims to provide insights into the impact of various public health strategies and inform decision-making during an epidemic.

## Key Features
**Susceptible Population (S(t)):** Analyzed how the susceptible population decreases as more individuals are exposed to the disease.

**Exposed Population (E(t)):** Studied the increase in exposure as individuals come into contact with infectious individuals.

**Quarantined Population** Examined the impact of quarantine measures, noting trends of initial decreases and subsequent increases based on epidemic escalation.

**Infected Population:** Observed how the infected population behaves during early control efforts and the subsequent rise in cases as measures respond to new waves of infection.

**Recovered Population:** Tracked the recovery process, noting how improvements in healthcare and treatment increased the recovery rates over time.

## Results
**Impact of Transmission Rates:** Investigated how varying transmission rates affected the infected and recovered populations, showing that higher transmission led to increased infections, while improved recovery measures accelerated recovery rates.
